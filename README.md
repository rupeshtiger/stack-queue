i have tried here to show the working of these algorithm.
A **stack** is a LIFO data structure where the last element added is the first to be removed. 
A **queue** is a FIFO data structure where the first element added is the first to be removed.
Both are fundamental in computer science, used in algorithms, memory management, and task scheduling.
